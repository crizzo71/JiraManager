## Configuration

### Configuration File
Settings are stored in `jira_config.json`:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://issues.redhat.com",
  "email": "user@company.com",
  "api_token": "your_api_token",
  "auth_method": "basic",
  "api_version": "v2",
  "selected_projects": [
    {"key": "OCM", "name": "OpenShift Cluster Manager"}
  ],
  "selected_boards": [
    {"id": "21633", "name": "OCM Kanban", "type": "kanban"}
  ]
}
```

### Finding Board IDs

Board IDs can be found in Jira URLs:
```
https://issues.redhat.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=21633
                                                          ^^^^^
                                                       Board ID
```

## Examples

### Daily Workflow Example
```bash
# Check current board status
python jira_manager.py board-issues 21633

# Generate weekly report for management
python jira_manager.py weekly-report 21633 --output "Weekly_Status_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md"
```

### Multi-Board Management
```bash
# Add multiple boards
python jira_manager.py add-board 21633  # OCM Kanban
python jira_manager.py add-board 22050  # Another board

# Generate reports for all boards
python jira_manager.py all-board-issues
```

### Executive Reporting
```bash
# Generate comprehensive executive report
python jira_manager.py weekly-report 21633 \
  --output "Executive_Weekly_Report_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md" \
  --days 7
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed:**
```bash
# Test your connection
python jira_manager.py test

# Re-run setup if needed
python jira_manager.py setup
```

**No Boards Found:**
- Use `python jira_manager.py add-board [ID]` to add boards manually
- Check board permissions in Jira

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify API token is still valid
- For Jira Server, try Personal Access Token instead
- Check if 2FA is interfering with authentication

**Date/Timezone Errors:**
- The tool automatically handles timezone differences
- If issues persist, try `--no-summary` for faster processing

### Performance Tips

- Use `--no-summary` for quick reports (5-10 seconds vs 30-60 seconds)
- Limit time ranges with `--days` parameter for large boards
- Test connection with `python jira_manager.py test` if experiencing slowness

## Advanced Usage

### API Compatibility
- **Jira Cloud**: Uses REST API v3 by default
- **Jira Server**: Automatically detects and uses REST API v2
- **Agile/Board APIs**: Tries multiple endpoints for maximum compatibility

### Batch Operations
```bash
# Generate reports for multiple boards
for board_id in 21633 22050 22100; do
  python jira_manager.py weekly-report $board_id --output "Report_${board_id}_$(date +%Y%m%d).md"
done
```

## Contributing

This tool was designed for Red Hat's Jira instance but works with any Jira Cloud or Server deployment.

### Extending the Tool
- Add new report formats in `generate_weekly_report()`
- Customize business impact scoring in `_assess_business_impact()`
- Add new issue filters in `get_board_issues_by_status()`

## Security

- Credentials are stored locally in `jira_config.json`
- API tokens are recommended over passwords
- No credentials are transmitted except to your specified Jira instance
- Use Personal Access Tokens for enhanced security in Jira Server

## License

This tool is designed for internal productivity and integrates with Atlassian Jira instances.
